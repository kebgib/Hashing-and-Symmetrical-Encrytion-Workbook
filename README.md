# Hashing-and-Symmetrical-Encrytion-Workbook

AGENDA:
 1.	The Python Interactive Development Environment (Python IDLE) 
 https://www.python.org/ 
 
 Feel free to grab Python 3.8 if you want to follow along, THIS IS NOT REQUIRED for this exercise/meeting

 2.	Assigning variables, calling variables, string encoding and byte code.
 
   a.	What is encoding? -- https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding
   
   b.	The above reading not required, but informative for modern computing basics for the curious.
   
   c.	We will be hashing and encrypting bytecode encoded data


 3.	Hashing data using SHA256 (Secure Hashing Algorithm 256 bit)

   a.	Main Topics: Hashing in modern computing, password storage, and content integrity. 
   
   b.	Examples in Python’s built in hashlib library -  https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html 
   
   c.	BONUS – ‘Cracking’ or reverse engineering hashed values


 4.	Symmetrical Encryption using AES128 –and- SHA256 for message authentication

   a.	Main Topics: Keys, and examples of failed decryption.
   
   b.	Examples in Python’s 3rd party Cryptography library (additional install required) https://cryptography.io/en/latest/ 
   

 5.	Roundtable/Open Discussion
